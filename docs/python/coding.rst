Coding Style

Familiarize yourself with:

- `The Zen of Python <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_ for our lofty ideals.
- `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style.html>`_ is our formatter of choice so it trumps all.
- `The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python <https://docs.python-guide.org/>`_

  - `Structuring Your Project <https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/>`_ describes a basic project layout (and some code style seem to be mixed in).
  - `Code Style <https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/>`_ is a simple style guide.

- `Google Python Style Guide <https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md>`_ to fill in the blanks, but it does have contradiction that would be trumped by the above guides.
- `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ for anything not previously covered.

Other influential resources:

- `Fluent Python <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do>`_
- `Effective Python <https://effectivepython.com/>`_

Todo:

- Logging
- docstrings style
- tests

"But I don't have time to read all this!"

Reading two articles from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python and using our cookiecutter should be enough to get started.
